# Real-Gas-Simulation
A pretty crude Van-der-Waals Gas simulation using the Runge-Kutta numeric method, written completely in smelly slow python. Takes years, but indeed does create a .gif of the simulation with your entered parameters in the same directory.
Hint: less particles = faster processing, less mass = faster moving entities.
An example of the gif is provided. The axis represent just a 50x50 box that limits the molecules.
